    <h1>Castle Escape</h1>
    
    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    <h3>High Concept</h3>
    <p>
        This game will be like "The World's Hardest Game" but it will have more of a story. Instead of just having different colored shapes, everything on screen will actually be something. For example, the player will move a character across the screen rather than a square and the user will pick up things like keys to open doors instead of just colored circles. The player will move their character through each level collecting keys and also avoiding ghosts on their journey to escape the castle.
    </p>

    <h3>Genre</h3>
    <p>
        This will be a strategy game that makes the player plan paths and time their movements. It will be an avoidance game because the user will be attempting to avoid ghosts while they move throughout the castle. Lastly, there will be escape and adventure elements to the game as the player moves throught the castle looking to escape.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>
        This game will be designed and developed for desktop-only playing.
    </p>

    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
        The theme of the game is for the player to move their character throught the levels trying to run away from the ghosts and escape from the castle. The mood of the game will be excitement as the player will find joy in completeing levels and reaching the exit of the castle. The 
        player will progress through each level of the game by finding a key in a room and using it to open a door. The user will be tempted to 
        continue playing as they will be driven to escape the castle and reach the end.
    </p>

    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <p>
        The graphics style will be cartoonish and I may use Adobe Illustrator to create simple vector art for some elements. The sound will be very simple with audio playing for finishing a level, collecting a coin, and getting hit by a ghost. I may also add simple background music.
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>
        The player will be able to move the character using WASD and that will be the main functionality of the game. I may add some sort of power-up that the player can collect and then use the space-bar to use. The player will learn the movement options on the screen of the first level as their will be some simple text to explain it. If I choose to incorporate a power-up on some levels I will have text to explain it on the level it's introduced on.

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>
        At this time I am still unsure of some of the details about the game. While I know what I want to do for the overall concept, I may change some of the theme of the game to move away from castle and ghosts but if I do this I will still keep a lot of the feel of the game the same.

    <h3>About the Developer</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Jacob Jablon and I am a 2nd year New Media Interactive Development major. When it comes to this project I think my skills lie in using JavaScript because it was the only coding language I had previously used before this semester. I am interested in putting my skills to the test and seeing how well I can create this game. I want to push myself to create somethign that I can actually be proud of.

    <h3>My Process</h3>
    <p>
        When I started working on this project I first took some time to come up with an idea for a game that I thought I was capable of building and that I would actually find fun to play. I decided to somewhat recreate "The World's Hardest Game" but to give it more of a story. When I started coding I began by creating the different screens that would be shown at different times depending on where the player was. After coding the buttons to move from screen to screen I then began creating the actual functionality of the game. This started by creating a character on each screen that could be moved using the mouse. I then coded the zombies that the player would need to avoid hitting. Then I created the box that the player can touch to complete each level and lastly I created the keys that the player need to collect to make the box appear. Up until this point I was just using images I found online as the main character, zombies, and keys so once I knew the functionality was mostly working I went into Adobe Illustrator and created all the graphic elements that the game uses. At this point I had only actually built out the first level so I then began to code other levels and in doing so I created two new classes for zombies that allow them to move in different ways. The end of my process included messing with the smaller details such as the typefaces, exact positioning of textand buttons, and the color palette. One of the final things I did was search for sound effects that I could use and then implement them into my code.

    <h3>Additional Comments</h3>
    <p>
        Something that I wanted to point out is that I created all the graphics myself using Adobe Illustrator.
    </p>

    <h3>Meeting the Requirements</h3>
    <p>
        I think I have met all of the requirements as I've worked through this project. To begin, I used multiple ES6 classes and all of my images are optimized for the sizes that are being displayed at. Additonally my proposal was submitted on time and I took part in the in-class critique. I think my code is running fairly smoothly and my html and css files are all valid. I think the formatting of some of my code could be slightly improved but I think the commenting is helpful in explaining each section. I also added multiple sound effects that play at different points during the game.
