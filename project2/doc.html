    <h2>My Process</h2>
    <p>
        When working on this project I started by choosing an API. The Rick and Morty API peaked my interest because I am a big fan of the shown and it is one of my favorite comedies. After choosing the Rick and Morty API I planned out how I wanted the layout of the website to be and what functionality the website would have. After this initial planning I jumped into the coding and tried to get the majortiy of the functionality to work and didn't think too much about the design. The most challenging part of my coding process was defiently the beginning when I tried to connect with the API and display the information on my site. This took me some time because I am relatively new to using APIs. After getting the connection to the API set up I was able to get information displayed on the screen and started working with the css to format it well and make the design appealing. My last steps involved ironing out the kinks to make the site work properly and always display information correctly.

    <h2>Additional Comments</h2>
    <p>
        While working on this project there were a few special efforts that I put in to make my site more appealing. The first thing I did was I added images to the search results for when the user searches for an episode. The API does not include images for each episode but I thought the site seemed like it was lacking something when the episode search results didn't include images. I decided to take the poster for each season and display them with episodes from their specific season. I also wanted to mention that my project stores not only the required last used search term, but also the category that the user last searched with.

    <h2>Meeting the Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        I think I met most of the requirements on this project as I worked through it. Firstly, I submitted the proposal on time and came to class prepared to share my progess and participate in our class' critique. I also think my project hits the requirements when it comes to functionality as it uses an API, uses local storage, has the minimum required controls, and all around does what it is supposed to do.
