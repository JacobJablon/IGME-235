                    Worked in a team of five to design and develop an interactive prototype for an informational website
                    on
                    how AI impacts the world.

                This project was exciting for me to work on because it was my first time using Axure. It was also my first time creating a prototype for a site so it was fun to work through the whole process and see the different steps. My team of five chose to focus the topic of our website on AI as it was a topic we had been learning about in class and that we had researched previously. This project gave me hands on experience for prototyping and encouraged me to consider the user when building out the site.

                My group started out with the basics considering who the audience for our site was and what our site was built to accomplish. When we chose our site's topic to be, "How AI Impacts the World," we then planned our different subsections of this category and from there we created a sitemap. We then created two wireframes, I created the one that we'd use on our home page, while another team member created the one that we used to make each of our subsection pages. We also went through a long process of choosing the design of our site, building a strong color palette, finding appropriate typefaces, and even searching for images. At this stage we moved our ideas to Photoshop, where we created a static mockup for a few of the pages to ensure that our content, layouts, and designs all worked well together. After making a few final tweaks we started using Axure where we each chose one subsection to focus on. I also chose to build the navigation bar and to build a simple image carousel on the home page that moves through three images created by AI. This project was a lot of fun to work on because as I was able to collaborate with others and build something that I think is actually cool. I found it somewhat difficult using Axure at first but as I worked through the project I started to understand it better and it became simple.
