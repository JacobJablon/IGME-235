                    This project takes data on health outcomes from two counties and displays the data in a way that
                    allows viewers to draw conclusions on health trends within these counties.

                This is my most recent project that I've worked on and it's the project that excites me the most. I find
                this project so exciting because it can have real world use to promote positive change. The code that I
                wrote displays a visual representation of health data for two counties in the United States. I began by
                loading in two JSON files containing data that had been gathered by the CDC and the US Census Bureau.
                The first JSON file had health data pertaining to Monroe, NY and the second pertained to Fulton, GA.
                Both JSON files contained an array of object literals, each containing health data on one tract within
                the county. The code I wrote takes specific health information from the data and displays it on the
                canvas represented as different sized shapes and in different colors. The shapes are displayed on the
                canvas relative to one another based on their geographic location. There is also a key on the canvas
                that explains what each of the shapes represent and explains what the size of each shape represents.
                This program has a user interface that is shown under the canvas and was created using DOM elements. The
                UI allows the user to change which county's data is being displayed, what information is being
                displayed, what portion of the data is displayed, and if labels containing the written out data is
                visible. Working on this project taught me how to load in external data, use international number
                formatters, and use math functions such as reduce, map, and lerp.

                The part of this project that challenged me the most was just figuring out how to look through a JSON
                file and take only certain parts of the data for my code. After playing around with it, I was able to
                understand how to do this though and I have a better understanding of what JSON files really are. This
                program is so exciting to me because it allows users to easily see things like the connection between
                the average median income of a tract and the percentage of white people in the population of the same
                tract. Finding these similarities allows people to easily see certain racial disparities. I enjoyed
                working on this program because I know that I can create similar ones in the future that lead to real
                positive change in the world.
