    <h2>Goal of my Site</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my site is to serve as a portfolio that displays who I am and the skills that I have. When building
        this site I considered my audience to be potential employers and hiring managers. I wanted my site to look very
        professional and demonstrate all the skills that I've learned so far in NMID. I specifically chose projects to
        include that I was proud of and that demonstrated skills in different areas. I wanted the design of my site to
        be strong as I've taken multiple design courses and understand the importance of a good design for the user's
        experience. I think my chosen color palette is the strongest element of my site's design because it helps create
        the repetition between different elements and works to draw the user's attention to important information. As I
        wanted the site to feel professional, I knew it would be important to ensure that different elements aligned
        nicely with eachother so I was very deliberate with selecting the margins and padding of every element. I also
        made sure that the first section I included top section was the projects section because I think that is the
        section that most hiring managers would actually want to see.
    </p>
    <h2>Additonal Notes About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        When working on this project I found the most challenging part making the nav bar responsive to a narrow
        viewport. This was difficult for me because I had a clear vision for what I wanted to create, yet I only had a
        little experience with certain parts of doing this. I decided that I wanted to make most of the options in the
        navigation bar collapse into one button that was a dropdown menu containing these options. We had done something
        similar in class that had a dropdown menu within a navigation bar but it wasn't quite the same as what I was
        trying to do. After looking through the example from class, researching how it could be done, and spending a lot
        of time testing different ideas, I was able to achieve the exact effect that I was hoping for and I'm very happy
        with my navigation bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I went above and beyond expectations when creating my responsive navigation bar. As I explained above,
        this took me a lot of time to implement and I think it works as it's supposed to, but I also think it is very
        visually apeealing. I also put in a little extra work to create three seprate pages that each cover one of the
        three projects I have displayed on the inde.html page. These pages didn't take me too long to work on, but I
        still put in a lot of effort because I want to create a real portfolio in the near future and this is similar to
        how I would want it to look. I also think I put in a little extra effort in the little details. For example, the
        first three lines of code in phase2.css work to make the scrolling smooth when clicking the fragment links. I
        also put in some extra research so that I could change the color of svg files to make them match my color
        palette.
