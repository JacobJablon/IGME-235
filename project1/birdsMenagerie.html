                When creating this project I built upon my JavaScript skills learning to use class inheritence and
                practicing adding and removing objects from arrays. This project also helped me understand DOM elements
                better and specifically how to properly space out DOM elements. When working on this project I began by
                creating the different classes for each of the birds as well as a class to manage the DOM element user
                interface. I enjoyed creating the visual display for each bird class and actually trying to make each
                class
                resemble a real bird species.
            </p>
            <p id="para2">
                This project served as very good practice on how to add objects into an array and how to call methods of
                class objects in an array. Calling methods of class instances within an array was probably the most
                difficult part of this project for me because I made a lot of syntax errors. Over time however, it
                became
                more intuitive to me and I started making less mistakes. Something that was new to me when working on
                this
                porject was trying to get instances from the same class to animate uniquely rather than in unison with
                instances from the same class. I enjoyed figuring out how to have unique animations for each bird
                instance
                because it really makes the visual come alive and feel less robotic. If I were to do this project again
                I
                would add more animation to the bird instances because as it is they all just have wings that flap at
                different times. I think it'd be cool to actually allow the birds to fly slightly up and down or left
                and
                right.
